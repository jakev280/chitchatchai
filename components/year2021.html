          Chit Chat Chai opened its doors in September 2021 at St Margaret’s Centre, creating a welcoming, women-only community space focused on English learning, wellbeing, and connection. The project
          supported around 20 learners from 11 countries through differentiated English classes, a
          supportive creche, and a community café that encouraged conversation, confidence, and friendship.

          The project supports around 20 regular learners from 11 different countries, with ages ranging from 29 to 70 and a wide variety of educational backgrounds.
          English classes are carefully differentiated by language level, delivered by skilled and dedicated volunteers, and enriched with real-world themes such as health, homes, cultural celebrations, and International Women’s Day.
          Learning regularly extends beyond the classroom through community visits and events, helping to build confidence, wellbeing, and belonging.
          Alongside language learning, the project promotes skills development and empowerment. Learners and volunteers have completed accredited Food Safety and First Aid
          training together, fostering shared achievement and stronger relationships. Growing digital confidence is encouraged through basic IT skills and a WhatsApp group that keeps learners connected.

          The café is a central pillar of Chit Chat Chai, providing a relaxed space for conversation, cultural exchange, creative activities, and friendship.
          Shared food and drink strengthen bonds between learners, volunteers, and community visitors, reinforcing English practice in an informal, supportive setting.
