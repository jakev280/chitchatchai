<h3> 2021 Hightlights</h3>

<p> 
  Chit Chat Chai began as a sanctuary for women to learn English, improve wellbeing, and build lasting connections. 
</p>

<p>  
  The project supports around 20 regular learners from 11 different countries, with ages ranging from 29 to 70 and a wide variety of educational backgrounds.
  English classes are carefully differentiated by language level, delivered by skilled and dedicated volunteers, and enriched with real-world themes such as health, homes, cultural celebrations, and International Women’s Day.
  Learning regularly extends beyond the classroom through community visits and events, helping to build confidence, wellbeing, and belonging.
  Alongside language learning, the project promotes skills development and empowerment. Learners and volunteers have completed accredited Food Safety and First Aid
  training together, fostering shared achievement and stronger relationships. Growing digital confidence is encouraged through basic IT skills and a WhatsApp group that keeps learners connected. 
</p>

<p>
    Chit Chat Chai actively works to build stronger communities by linking participants to local services, events,
    and activities, including art gallery visits, park sessions, walking events, and future cycling initiatives. Social
    media presence continues to grow, helping learners engage digitally and celebrate progress.
