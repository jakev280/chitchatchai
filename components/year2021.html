  <h3>2021 Highlights</h3>

  <p>

    Chit Chat Chai opened its doors in September 2021 at St Margaret’s Centre, creating a welcoming, women-only community space focused on English learning, wellbeing, and connection. The project

    supported around 20 learners from 11 countries through differentiated English classes, a

    supportive creche, and a community café that encouraged conversation, confidence, and friendship.
