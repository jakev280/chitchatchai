                "For me, a seed was probably embedded in my subconscious growing up in London over 60 years ago..."

            <p class="mb-4">
                My parents moved to London in 1962. My father could speak English, but my mother, who had never attended school in India, could not. Settling in Southall had its challenges; my mother found comfort in her local community, but because she worked in a factory that didn't require English, she never learned to communicate in the language of her new home.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                As siblings, we spoke English to each other. My mother rarely conversed with us beyond instructions in Punjabi. This created a disconnect I felt deeply—especially at school parents' evenings, where my mother couldn't speak to my teachers or my friends.
            </p>

            <div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0; border: 1px dashed var(--nature-green);">
                <p style="margin: 0;">
                    Years later, while working at <strong>St Margaret’s Primary School</strong>, I saw mothers who reminded me of my own. They were asking for English classes, but the only options were formal college courses that weren't easily accessible.

            <p class="mb-4">
                After volunteering with Talk English and many chats with like-minded friends, we set up <strong>Chit Chat Chai</strong> when I retired in September 2021. We wanted to provide a sense of belonging and enrichment.

            <p class="mb-6">
                The café space was envisaged as a place to practice English and relax, but it has evolved into so much more. Waking up on a Monday morning to teach at CCC is an absolute pleasure. Between the delicious food and the warmth of the volunteers, we are sure the learners feel the same sense of welcome that we do.
